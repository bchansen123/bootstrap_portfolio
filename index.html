                                I live in Saratoga Springs in a house I built in the spring of 2019. I own two dogs named Winston and Wilfred. Winston is a Great Pyrenees and Wilfred is a Newfoundland. Wilfred is still a puppy at 9 months old, but he weighs over 100 pounds already. They go through about 100 pounds of dog food a month. Talk about a food bill...

                                Currently I work as a Senior Customer Success Manager at Thumbtack. I have been there for the past two and a half years. Before that, I was a Program Account Manager at eBay, where I worked for 8 years. I have my degree in graphic design and attended the Art Institute of Salt Lake City in Draper. I graduated in 2013.
